# Social Network

On the 9th week of Full Stack JavaScript Web Development coding bootcamp at SPICED Academy, I build a single-page social network.

### Users can:

- register and log in (passwords are hashed and salted),


- upload a picture, add and edit their bio,


- send friend requests to other users, accept receivedfriend requests or terminate an existing friendship,


- see online users,


- send an instant message on a group chat

### Technologies used:

- ReactJS & Redux
- Node.js & Express.js
- PostgreSQL Database
- AWS S3 for Image Storage
- Socket.IO

This project was my first introduction to ReactJS and Redux. I also has a chance to build a live chat using Socket.IO.
